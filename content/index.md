# **eigenwallet**

## Abstract

**_eigenwallet_** is an ambitious community effort to build the Monero wallet
for the future.

Previously known as _UnstoppableSwap_ ([Why rename?](rename.html)).

---

## What?

**_eigenwallet_** is an ambitious effort to combine the frontier of crypto
privacy technology in a neat user-friendly packaging and make it accessible to
all.

- _eigenwallet_ is a self-custody Monero and Bitcoin wallet
- _eigenwallet_ is a battle-tested ($>3$ years) Monero $\leftrightarrow$ Bitcoin
  atomic swap implementation (called [_eigenswap_](eigenswap.html))
- _eigenwallet_ provides network privacy with its first-class Tor support (using
  arti^[9])
- _eigenwallet_ is platform-agnostic and works on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS and
  Android
- _eigenwallets_ form a peer-to-peer network between its users which we call the
  [_eigenweb_](eigenweb.html).
- _eigenwallet_ magically syncs itself across different devices using a protocol
  called [_eigensync_](eigensync.html).

**_eigenwallet_** shares a tech stack with upcoming Monero tech (Rust + Libp2p).
It's perfectly positioned to integrate these in the future:

- _eigenwallet_ will be a Monero node (using cuprate^[10])
- _eigenwallet_ will bring its users access to Serai DEX^[12]
- _eigenwallet_ can bring payment channels to life (using grease-xmr^[11])

## Why?

To understand what we are building (and why) we must hold a few truths to be
non-negotiable.

**(1)** The primary use case for crypto is to be:

- peer-to-peer electronic cash^[1]
- a system to store, hold and transfer value irrespective of borders and
  governments

**(2)** Bitcoin is the most prominent attempt at establishing such a system.
Having gained widespread acceptance, it is here to stay for a while. It will
continue to be acquirable to most people on this planet for the foreseeable
future.

**(3)** Privacy is the most important aspect of any peer-to-peer electronic cash
system. Without it fungibility cannot be achieved. Bitcoin's public ledger
severely lacks in this regard.

**(4)** Monero is currently the best attempt at a better system. It is the best
choice because it:

- offers reasonably private transactions through ring signatures and
  bulletproofs^[2]
- enforces non-transparent uniform transactions
- has the largest user base of any privacy coin (by far), giving it the largest
  possible anonymity set^[4]
- has gained widespread adoption in circles where privacy is paramount^[5]
- has been chosen most valuable by the market^[8]
- has shown to be eager and willing to adopt new technology (eg FCMP++)^[3]

**(5)** Monero is under constant attack. It lives under the constant threat of
delistings. It is not unreasonable to assume that it will be banned from most
exchanges within the next 3-5 years^[6].

**(6)** We cannot rely on centralized exchanges. Governments will continue to
crack down against Monero^[7]. Centralized entities will fold under pressure
because they do not want to go to prison, and they need to stay profitable. This
will impact the ability to onboard new users to the network if the community
does not develop a reliable onramp that does not rely on the continued
functioning of these institutions.

Therefore any onramp **must**:

- be non-custodial (meaning users do not give up access to their private keys)
- be censorship resistant (meaning it does not rely on a central authority)
- provide radical privacy (both on the protocol and network level)
- have high liquidity (comparable to centralized exchanges)

The goal of _eigenwallet_ is to build exactly that onramp. In the process we
will be building a great wallet as well.

## Why "_eigenwallet_"?

- "eigen" means "to own" in german, emphasizing the self-ownership and
  self-custody you hold over your funds when using _eigenwallet_
- "eigen" is a prefix used for mathematical concepts (like eigenvalues and
  eigenvectors). Crypto and math are intrinstrically intertwined
- we use an algorithm called _eigentrust_ to build a decentralized trust system
  and assign a local trust score to each _peer_
- we think it sounds **cool**
